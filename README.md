- **NPM** in the version **6.14.x**

## Settings âš™

### Database

It is necessary to enter the **config.json** file that is inside the config folder at the root of the project,
later configure in this file your postgres credentials ("database name, username and password").
By default you need to have a database called **"todo"**, a username called postgres with the password **root**

### Environment Variables

npm run start:dev
```

If it is not required to initialize the project with nodemon, it can be done as follows:

```
npm run start
```
